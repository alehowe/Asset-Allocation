# Guidelines

This project conducts an analysis of portfolio construction methodologies, including the formulation of portfolio frontiers using standard techniques, resampling methods, the Black-Litterman approach with various constraints and statistical techniques such as PCA. Portfolios are assessed based on performance metrics, risk evaluation and diversification measures. 
You can find the problem statement [here](https://github.com/alehowe/Asset-Allocation/blob/main/ExamB_2024.pdf), a detailed explanation of the methodologies used in the [report](https://github.com/alehowe/Asset-Allocation/blob/main/Group5_Report.pdf).
